============================
query AppPage {
  Restaurant(where: {id: {_eq: 1}}){
    name
  }
  Classification(where: {name: {_in: ["Steak", "Soup", "Desserts"]}}) {
    name
    MenuItems(where: {restaurant_id: {_eq: 1}}) {
      name
      img
      price
      is_veg
    }
  }
}


TODO: Create arguments for query
TODO: How can we update classification.name as filed in parent ?
TODO: How can we make this as array field
TODO: How to version control GQL API(s) and DB fields

I don't think we can live with current hasura solution, many reasons.
1. Tagging menu item is a must. Without this we cannot display promotional items.
2. Without being able to version control HASURA configs, solution is a no go.

TODO: There is something called prisma, it could be interesting to check that out.
